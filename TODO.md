# TODO list

1. create a baseline on Ond≈ôejov dataset so that there is a clear result to
   compare to (use a linear model for example)
2. integrate candidates script
   into [spectraml](https://github.com/podondra/spectraml/) project
3. reimplement the iterative CNN code for the purpose of paper publishing
4. make a t-SNE vizualization for paper publication purpose
5. try unsupervised pretraining explainde in chapter 15 of the
   [Deep Learning](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/) book.
